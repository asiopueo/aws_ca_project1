RTO - Recovery Time Objective

The Recovery Time Objective is the time the offered service is down, i.e. customers cannot access the portal of the service anymore.


RPO - Recovery Point Objective

The Recovery Point Objective is the time interval in which data is unrecoverably lost. For example, when the database to collect orders of a web shop is down, 
but the front end of the shop is still up. In this case, customers will still be able to place orders, but these orders will not be recorded by the backend and 
hence cannot be processed further - the order data will inevitably be lost and disgrunteled customers will turn away from the service, probably forever.
